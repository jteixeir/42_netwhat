Question 3
Which of this is not true?
1) UDP is a datagram-oriented protocol.
2) The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP.
3) UDP is faster, simpler and more efficient than TCP.
4) UDP provides extensive error checking mechanisms. It is because it provides flow control and acknowledgment of data.
5) UDP suuports Broadcasting.
6) There is no sequencing of data in UDP. If ordering is required, it has to be managed by application layer.
