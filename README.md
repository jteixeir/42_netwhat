4. Which of this is not true?

- a) UDP is a datagram-oriented protocol.
- b) The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP.
- c) UDP is faster, simpler and more efficient than TCP.
- d) UDP provides extensive error checking mechanisms. It is because it provides flow control and acknowleadgment of data 
- e) UDP supports Broadcasting
- f) There is no sequencing of data in UDP. If ordering is required, it has to be managed by the application layer.
